I'm a Ph.D. student at the **School of Electrical Engineering at Yanshan University**, Qinhuangdao, China, supervised by Prof. [Jing Yan](https://web.ysu.edu.cn/YJ3/zh_CN/index.htm) in YSO Lab. Since 2024, I have been a research fellow at the **Department of Electrical and Information Engineering at the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio**, Cassino, Italy, supervised by Prof. [Gianluca Antonelli](https://sites.google.com/unicas.it/gianluca-antonelli) in [LAI Lab](https://lairobotics.unicas.it/home). My current research interests include **Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS)**, **underwater intervention**, and **acoustic localization of underwater targets**.
